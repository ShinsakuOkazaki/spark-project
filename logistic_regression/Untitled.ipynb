in natureeffect of federal magistrates court rules 2001  r 44.12whether leave to appeal required under federal court of australia act 1976  s 24.migrationprocedureThis is a purported appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate.The Magistrate made an order dismissing an application under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958  ('the Act').The application to the Federal Magistrates Court under s 476 of the Act was supported by an affidavit as required by r 44.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 and it came before the Magistrate on a first court date on 30 January 2006.At that time, it was not clear to the Magistrate that the application disclosed an arguable case and, accordingly, he listed the matter for a hearing under r 44.12 so that he could determine whether the application raised an arguable case.He gave the applicant the opportunity to amend her application and to file further affidavits.No further affidavits were filed.Two amended applications were filed, but it is unnecessary for me to set out the details of those applications.The hearing under r 44.12 took place on 3 March 2006.The Magistrate concluded that the application failed to disclose an arguable case within r 44.12 and, accordingly, he dismissed it.On 23 March 2006 the applicant filed a notice of appeal from the decision in this Court.Rule 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 makes it clear that an order for dismissal under paragraph  is an interlocutory order.The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs filed a notice of objection to competency of the appeal and submits that the appeal is not competent in the absence of a grant of leave to appeal.In my opinion, that submission is correct.The order made by the Magistrate is interlocutory, and under s 24 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 , leave to appeal is required.The Minister does not object to me treating the purported notice of appeal as an application for leave to appeal, and I think that that is the appropriate course.The test for granting leave to appeal is well known and I will not repeat it: Decor Corporation v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399-400.The applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China, and she arrived in Australia on 15 March 2005.On 26 April 2005, she lodged an application for a protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs under the Act.On 5 August 2005, a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refused to grant a protection visa.On 6 September 2005, the applicant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a review of that decision.The applicant was born on 6 March 1957 and she claims that she is one of the leaders of Falon Gong in Shanghai, China.She claims that the Chinese authorities regard Falon Gong as an illegal organisation.She claims that she helped to organise a number of activities related to Falon Gong.She claims that she was warned about her involvement in Falon Gong by the local police and local government.She claims that in April 2001, she was put into detention for one month.She claims that in October 2002, she was ordered to attend a 're-education' centre for two months.She claims that in May 2003, she was imprisoned for one week because an unidentified person told the police that she practised Falon Gong every day.On 28 September 2005, the Tribunal wrote to the applicant and advised her that it had considered the material before it in relation to the application, but was unable to make a decision in her favour on that information alone.The applicant was invited to attend a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence and present arguments in support of her claims.She was told that if she did not attend the hearing and if the Tribunal did not postpone the hearing, then the Tribunal could make a decision on her case without further notice.She was advised that the proposed hearing would take place on 28 October 2005.The applicant did not attend the proposed hearing of the Tribunal.On 31 October 2005, she was advised that the Tribunal had made a decision, and that it would hand down its decision on 22 November 2005.The Tribunal decided to affirm the decision of the delegate of the Minister.In the course of its reasons, the Tribunal said: Generally, where broad allegations are made, the Tribunal hearing is an opportunity for the Tribunal to gather detail about the claims with the applicant.The applicant has been put on notice by the Tribunal that it is unable to make a favourable decision on the information before it but has not provided any further information in support of her claims despite ample opportunity to do so.Nor has she given the Tribunal the opportunity to explore aspects of her claims with her.A number of relevant questions are therefore left unanswered.At hearing, for example, I would have wanted to satisfy myself that the applicant is indeed a genuine Falon Gong practitioner.I have been unable to do that.As to her claims to have been detained at various times, I would have wanted to hear more details about the circumstances to satisfy myself that that really occurred.I have been unable to do that.Finally, I would have wanted to know why she did not leave China for nearly two years after her last detention.The applicant raised two main points before the Magistrate.First, she asserted that the Tribunal did not comply with its obligation under s 425 of the Act to invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments.Secondly, she asserted that the Tribunal did not comply with its obligation under s 424A of the Act, in that it did not give her particulars of relevant information.The specific information she asserted that the Tribunal was obliged to disclose was the fact that it would draw an adverse inference against her by reason of the fact that she did not leave China for nearly two years after her last detention.The Magistrate rejected both of these grounds.In essence, the applicant submitted that he erred in doing so.As to the first ground, the Magistrate made findings of fact which establish that the Tribunal met its obligation under s 425 of the Act to invite the applicant to a hearing and that the Tribunal was entitled to proceed in the absence of the applicant when she failed to appear at the time and place fixed for the hearing.The applicant did not identify any error in relation to those findings.As to the second ground, the Magistrate rejected the challenge of the Tribunal's approach for a number of reasons.First, he concluded that all the Tribunal member was saying was that that was an issue that he would like to have explored with the applicant and that that was not an error.Secondly, the comment was based on information provided by the applicant, and, accordingly, did not need to be disclosed by reason of the provisions of s 424A of the Act.Thirdly, the Magistrate said that the information did not need to be disclosed because it was the insufficiency of the information that was determinative and not any particular information contained in the visa application.The Magistrate referred to the decision in SZBCS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1457.I agree with each of the reasons identified by the Magistrate.His conclusions are supported by authority, including VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 per Finn and Stone JJ at 476-477, at [24] and SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238.Neither ground of challenge is arguable and, in those circumstances, the application for leave to appeal must be dismissed with costs.I will hear the parties as to whether I should order costs in a fixed amount pursuant to O 62 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules .\"),\n",

       "  'bankruptcy noticefailure by creditor to attach to notice a copy of judgment or ordernotice set aside.bankruptcyThis is an application to set aside Bankruptcy Notice 190 of 2005 (\"the Notice\") issued to the applicant (\"Genovese\") under the Bankruptcy Act 1966  (\"the Act \") by the Official Receiver for the Bankruptcy District of Western Australia on 13 June 2005 at the request of the respondent (\"BGC\").The Notice is the fourth such notice to be issued to Genovese at BGC\\'s request based on a judgment obtained by BGC against Genovese in the Local Court of Western Australia on 17 October 2003.Judgment was entered by consent for a sum of $10,000 and costs to be taxed.Those costs were taxed and certified on 23 December 2003 in a sum of $11,432.94.Prior to 17 October 2003 other orders for costs had been made in the proceeding in BGC\\'s favour namely, on 28 February 2003, 15 April 2003 and 9 June 2003.On 22 May 2003 costs were taxed pursuant to the orders made on 28 February and 15 April 2003 and certified by the Taxing Officer in a sum of $2,010.42.That sum was duly paid by Genovese.In respect of the order for costs made on 9 June 2003 taxed costs were certified on 29 October 2003 in a sum of $4,979.33.The first bankruptcy notice, issued on 12 March 2004, was set aside by consent.The second and third bankruptcy notices were issued on 21 April 2004 and 8 September 2004 respectively.BGC elected not to proceed on the second notice and the third notice was set aside by an order made by a judge of this Court (Lander J) on 11 March 2005 on appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court.The reasons for decision of his Honour set out the history of the matter in detail.See: Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 440).An unresolved issue that arose out of the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court and not dealt with in the appeal is whether a further sum of $3,000 was paid to BGC by Genovese on 30 April 2004 in reduction of the judgment entered on 17 October 2003 being a sum not accounted for in the Notice.See: Genovese v Homestyle Pty Ltd [2004] FMCA 673 at [33] ).On 25 July 2005 Genovese filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking an order that the Notice be set aside.On 21 September 2005 the Federal Magistrates Court ordered that the application be transferred to this Court by reason of the complexity of the issues raised.Upon transfer of the matter the Court determined pursuant to Order 80 of the Rules of the Federal Court that it was appropriate that the Registrar be directed to obtain pro bono legal representation for Genovese in order that the Court may be assisted by submissions from counsel for each party.Up to that point Genovese had been unrepresented.As far as the instant matter is concerned s 40 of the Act provides that a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy if a creditor who has obtained against the debtor a final judgment or final order, the execution of which has not been stayed, has served on the debtor a bankruptcy notice under the Act requiring the debtor to pay the judgment debt and the debtor does not, within the time specified in the notice, comply with the requirements of the notice.Section 41 states that an Official Receiver may issue a bankruptcy notice on the application of a creditor who has obtained against a debtor a final judgment or final order (or two or more final judgments or final orders) in an amount of at least $2,000.Section 41 stipulates that the notice must be in the form prescribed by the Bankruptcy Regulations 1966  (\"the Regulations\").Regulation 4.02 provides that Form 1 in Schedule 1 of the Regulations is the prescribed form.Regulation 4.02 also states that a bankruptcy notice must follow Form 1 in respect of its format --- \"for example, bold or italic typeface, underlining and notes\".Item 1 of Form 1 gives notice to a debtor that the creditor claims that the debtor owes the creditor a debt in a specified amount arising under a judgment and states that details of the amount of the debt are shown in the Schedule to the Form.The Schedule provides for details of the amount owing to the creditor by the debtor under judgments or orders to be inserted.Item 2 of Form 1 states that \"a copy\" of the judgments or orders \"relied upon\" by the creditor is attached to the notice.Failure to attach a copy of a judgment or order relied upon is a failure to comply with s 41 and represents a fundamental defect in the notice and invalidates it.See: The Australian Steel Company (Operations) Pty Ltd v Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; (2000) 109 FCR 33; Commonwealth Bank v Horvath (Junior) (1999) 161 ALR 441).In relevant respects the Schedule to Form 1 reads as follows: Column 1 Column 2 1 Amount of judgments or orders plus 2 Legal costs if ordered to be paid and a specific amount was not included in the judgments or orders (see Note 1 , below) plus 3 If claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, interest accrued since the date of judgments or orders (see Note 2 , below) Subtotal less 5 Payments made and/or credits allowed since date of judgments or orders Total debt owing NB: Amounts, where applicable, are to be inserted in column 2)Note 1 : Legal costs (item 2 of the Schedule)If legal costs are being claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, a certificate of taxed or assessed costs in support of the amount claimed must be attached to this Bankruptcy Notice.The particulars inserted in the Schedule to the Notice were as follows: Column 1 Column 2 Amount of judgments or orders $28,422.69 plus 2 Legal costs if ordered to be paid and a specific amount was not included in the judgments or orders (see Note 1 , below) plus 3 If claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, interest accrued since the date of judgments or orders (see Note 2 , below) NIL Subtotal $28,422.69 less 5 Payments made and/or credits allowed since date of judgments or orders $ 2,010.40 Total debt owing $26,412.29 \" When the matter came on for hearing on 15 December 2005 counsel for Genovese submitted that the Notice failed to comply with the requirements of the Act and the Regulations.Plainly the amount set out in Item 1 of the Notice and in Item 1 of the Schedule to the Notice was a composite sum based on several judgments or orders.Whether pursuant to Item 2 of the Notice BGC had to attach a copy of the costs orders made on 28 February, 15 April and 9 June 2003 is unnecessary to decide.At least pursuant to Item 2 and Note 1 of the Schedule to the Notice the certificates of the taxed costs made pursuant to those orders had to be attached.Although unnecessary to decide in the instant case it may be thought that the words of Item 2 and of Note 1 of the Schedule to the Notice make it clear that costs not fixed but ordered to be paid as part of a judgment or order must be set out in Item 2 of the Schedule and a certificate of those taxed costs attached.I note that in Stec v Orfanos [1999] FCA 457 at [17] it is suggested that it is not necessary to attach a certificate of taxed costs where a judgment recited in Item 1 of the Schedule provides for costs to be taxed.But such a conclusion would not be consistent with the words used in Item 2 of the Schedule or Note 1 and, furthermore, would fail to meet the evident purpose of a bankruptcy notice prescribed by the Act and Regulations, namely, to give a debtor notice of how the amount set out in the Notice has been calculated as the amount owing.Item 2 of the Schedule is not restricted to legal costs not included in the judgments or orders referred to in Item 1.It expressly applies to legal costs ordered to be paid where a specific amount has not been included in a judgment or order referred to in Item 1.The words of Note 1 confirm that construction.Therefore, if costs are ordered but not fixed in a judgment or order set out in Item 1 the amount of those costs as subsequently taxed or assessed must be set out in Item 2 and a certificate of the taxed or assessed costs must be attached.On the reasoning applied in Stec there would be no function for Note 1 to the Schedule to perform.The amounts due under more than one final judgment or order, including a costs order, would be aggregated in Item 1 of the Schedule and pursuant to the reasoning in Stec no amount or certificate of costs taxed pursuant to a costs order could be said to be relevant to Item 2 and Note 1 of the Schedule.In any event to comply with the requirements of the Act it was necessary for BGC to deliver to the Official Receiver for attachment to the Notice a copy of the judgment entered in the Local Court on 17 October 2003 and a copy of any other order for the payment of costs that BGC sought to have included in the Notice as the debt claimed to be due.See: Commonwealth Bank v Horvath ).The document dated 6 April 2005 attached to the Notice purported to be a certified copy of the judgment entered on 17 October 2003.It misstated the amount of that judgment debt by aggregating with that sum amounts of taxed costs that became payable under other orders.No copies of those other orders, or certificates of the costs taxed pursuant thereto, were attached to the Notice.It may be assumed that pursuant to O 23 r 6 of the Local Court Rules 1961 , BGC prepared a praecipe of the certified judgment sought to be attached to the Notice and was responsible for the misstatement in the Notice of the amount of the judgment debt entered on 17 October 2003.In light of the foregoing BGC conceded that the Notice must be set aside.It contended, however, that no costs order should be made.Counsel for Genovese submitted that costs should follow the event.The grounds of BGC\\'s argument on costs were that BGC had incurred unnecessary expense in preparing a response to arguments foreshadowed by Genovese as an unrepresented applicant but abandoned by counsel for Genovese.Further it was submitted that the ground raised by counsel for Genovese only materialised \"at the eleventh hour\".Counsel for Genovese submitted that the Bankruptcy Notice was defective on its face and that the usual order for costs should be made.I am satisfied that the discretion available to the Court under s 43 of the Federal Court Act 1976  should be exercised by an order that BGC pay the costs of Genovese.BGC had four opportunities to present a bankruptcy notice for issue that complied with requirements of the Act and Regulations and failed to do so.The defect in the Notice should have been apparent to BGC at the time the Notice was presented to the Official Receiver for endorsement and issue.Whilst it was not until Genovese was represented by counsel that the ground on which the challenge to the validity of the Notice was able to be articulated on behalf of Genovese, BGC had been on notice since the filing of the application that the validity of the Notice was in issue and it could have ascertained by appropriate examination of the primary documents that the Notice was defective.By reason of the amendments made to the Act and Regulations in respect of bankruptcy notices considered and explained in Australian Steel, responsibility for the accuracy of a bankruptcy notice issued by the Official Receiver now lies with the creditor seeking the issue of the notice and not with a Registrar in Bankruptcy or an Official Receiver.It follows that a creditor requesting the issue of such a notice must exercise due care to ensure that there has been compliance with the Act and Regulations.See: Australian Steel at [53], [63]).The Notice will be set aside and BGC ordered to pay the costs of the application.'),\n",

justice generallybalance of convenienceconsideration of public interestwhere documents proposed to be published prior to forthcoming commission hearingsinjunctionscontempt of courtOn 9 August 2006, I made an interim order on the ex parte application of the applicant, AWB Limited ('AWB'), restraining the first respondent until 4.30pm on 10 August 2006 from publishing or disclosing any of the documents referred to in exhibit JMC4 to the affidavit of Mr John Mitchell, sworn 9 August 2006 ('the documents').The documents comprise draft statements of contrition which are no longer the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege and which contain various references to legal advice obtained by AWB.AWB now applies, by notice of motion dated 10 August 2006, for a continuation of the non-publication order until the hearing or determination of this proceeding.The first respondent has informed the Court that he will abide any order of the Court, but that in the absence of a restraining order he proposes to publish the documents as they are no longer the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege.BACKGROUND On 25 May 2006, AWB supplied the documents to the Commission of Inquiry that is being conducted by the first respondent ('the Inquiry') pursuant to notices to produce issued by the first respondent.The documents had originally been withheld from production on the ground of legal professional privilege.After my decision in AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole [2006] FCA 571 , AWB determined that a claim for privilege could not be maintained over the documents.AWB supplied the documents to the Inquiry under cover of a letter dated 25 May 2006 which stated that it did not claim legal professional privilege over the documents.The covering letter did not make any claim that the documents should be kept confidential.In the course of proceedings before me, Mr Judd, senor counsel for AWB, confirmed that AWB does not seek to assert any claim of legal professional privilege over the documents.In correspondence and other exchanges between AWB's solicitors and the Inquiry this week, the Inquiry told AWB on several occasions that it intends to publish the documents.The most relevant exchanges are these: On 8 August 2006, the solicitor assisting the Inquiry, Mr Owbridge, wrote to the solicitors for AWB and advised that the documents would be tendered at the Inquiry on 8 or 9 August 2006.In this letter, Mr Owbridge observed that there appeared to be no commercial confidentiality claims in respect of any of the documents.AWB's solicitors immediately responded by letter dated 8 August 2006 and requested confirmation that the Inquiry would not take any action to publish any of the documents pending the determination of this proceeding.This letter appears to have crossed with an email from Mr Owbridge which stated that the documents would be published on the Inquiry's website shortly rather than later on 8 August 2006 as previously advised.Mr Mitchell then had a telephone conversation with Mr Owbridge in which Mr Mitchell asked for an opportunity to claim confidentiality and to consider any privilege issues that arise out of the production of the documents to the Inquiry.A little later that day Mr Owbridge sent an email to AWB's solicitors stating that the documents would be published at 5.00pm on 8 August 2006, pending AWB's claims for commercial confidentiality.AWB's solicitors responded by a further letter dated 8 August and asked that the documents be kept confidential and not published and advised that disclosure of those parts of the documents that referred to earlier legal advice would, if published on the website, adversely affect AWB's claims for legal professional privilege in this proceeding.The Inquiry's final letter on 8 August 2006 advised AWB's solicitors that the documents would not be published before midday on 9 August 2006.A few minutes before 4.15pm on 9 August 2006, AWB's solicitors received a letter from the solicitor assisting the Inquiry which advised that, as no sensible basis had been advanced as to why the documents should remain confidential and as no application to restrain publication had been made, the Inquiry proposed to publish the documents at 4.30pm that afternoon.The last mentioned letter led directly to AWB's ex parte application and my interim order of 9 August 2006.On 10 August 2006, the solicitors acting for the first respondent in this proceeding forwarded a letter to AWB's solicitors which advised that, while the first respondent would abide an order of the Court, his position remained that he proposed to publish the documents on the Inquiry's website as they were not the subject of any claim for legal professional privilege.The letter also advised that the Inquiry wishes to publish the documents prior to the resumption of hearings by the Inquiry so that persons given leave to appear will have a reasonable opportunity of considering the additional documentary evidence.The first respondent intends to resume public hearings on 22 August 2006.ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH THE COURT'S PROCESSES AWB founds its application for interlocutory relief on the contention that publication of the documents would interfere with the orderly disposition of the issues in this case, or in subsequent cases, and therefore amounts to a threatened contempt of Court.AWB submitted that one of the issues in this case is that of imputed waiver.Specifically, the issue before this Court is whether AWB has waived privilege over documents that are said to be associated with legal advices that AWB has disclosed to the Inquiry.In these circumstances, AWB submitted that the Commonwealth may wish to use the Inquiry's public dissemination of the documents to support its imputed waiver argument in this case, and that other litigants may wish to do so in subsequent cases.This Court has power under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976  to make orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders, as the Court thinks appropriate.That power extends to the making of orders that are necessary to enable the Federal Court to exercise its jurisdiction effectively, or to prevent any abuse or frustration of, or interference with, its processes: see Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 (' Patrick' ), at 32-33 [35] per Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, and at 61-62 [127] per Gaudron J; and Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 at 217-218 [10] - [12] and [15] per Gleeson CJ, at 231-232 [60] per Gaudron J, and at 241 [91] and 242-243 [93]-[94] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.The authorities establish that Courts can restrain executive action where it poses a real risk of interfering with the processes of the Court or the administration of justice generally: see Brambles Holdings Limited v Trade Practices Commission (1980) 32 ALR 328; Hammond v Commonwealth [1982] HCA 42 ; (1982) 152 CLR 188; and Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees &amp; Builders Labourers' Federation [1982] HCA 31 ; (1982) 152 CLR 25.Where the Court is considering an interlocutory injunction based on an apprehended contempt of Court, the Court asks whether the conduct poses a real risk of interfering with the processes of the Court or the administration of justice generally.As this question will only arise on the interlocutory application, and not at trial, the question is not normally posed in terms of a serious question to be tried.Rather, the question is whether the evidence establishes a real risk of interference.In the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that the material demonstrates a real risk that the publication of the documents will interfere with the processes of the Court or the administration of justice generally.I have reached that conclusion for several reasons.In the first place, AWB provided the documents to the Commission pursuant to notices to produce on the footing that the documents are no longer the subject of the claim for legal professional privilege.Any conduct by AWB from which waiver could be imputed ended at the point at which it disclosed the references to legal advice to the Inquiry.Any further publication beyond that point is solely attributable to the first respondent.Further, AWB has asserted a claim for confidentiality and it has asked the Commission not to publish the documents on grounds of confidentiality.Section 6D of the Royal Commissions Act 1902  gives the first respondent the power to direct that documents relevant to his inquiries not be published.The terms of reference of the Inquiry also contemplate that the first respondent will take steps to protect the confidentiality of documents where it is appropriate to do so.AWB's claim for confidentiality was founded on the same risk of prejudice as underpins this application; there was no claim for commercial confidentiality.The first respondent rejected the claim for confidentiality and has apparently formed the view that it is necessary to publish the documents for the purposes of the forthcoming hearings.In claiming confidentiality (albeit unsuccessfully) and in making this application for an interlocutory injunction, AWB has done everything within its power to prevent the publication of the documents.It is difficult to see why, in those circumstances, the step that the Inquiry wishes to take of publishing the documents on its website would increase the risk that AWB's conduct would be regarded as effecting a waiver of privilege over other documents.Imputed waiver arises where the party claiming legal professional privilege engages in conduct which is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect: Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 13 [29] .Secondly, the references to legal advice in the documents have essentially the same character as other disclosures that AWB has previously made to the Commission.Those disclosures have been the subject of evidence in public proceedings at the Inquiry, and are already in the public domain.It is difficult to see why the additional references in the documents to legal advice would alter the risk of waiver that AWB already confronts as a result of the prior publication of very similar material.Thirdly, in the course of this case, the Commonwealth has relied upon previous occasions on which AWB has disclosed the existence and substance of legal advice to contend that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated documents.Mr Harrison, senior counsel for the Commonwealth, informed the Court that the Commonwealth does not intend to rely upon the further references to legal advice in the documents in support of its waiver arguments in these proceedings.AWB argues that, even if these additional references are not to be relied upon by the Commonwealth in this case, that does not remove the risk that in another piece of litigation, at some later point, some other party will seek to rely upon these additional references to argue that AWB has thereby waived privilege over other documents.I do not think that this possible future circumstance supports AWB's contention that publication poses a real risk of interference with the processes of this Court or the administration of justice generally.AWB did not base its application on any contention that the first respondent had exercised his powers improperly or for any extraneous purpose.Its application was based solely on principles of contempt of Court.BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE Turning to the balance of convenience, I am not satisfied that the publication of the documents will cause irreparable harm or any serious prejudice to AWB.In my view, the risk of prejudice to which AWB points is remote.I must also take account of the public interest in the conduct of the Inquiry and the first respondent's desire to conduct further proceedings in public at which these additional documents may be the subject of evidence.This consideration outweighs the remote risk of any prejudice to AWB.CONCLUSION For these reasons, I refuse the application for interlocutory relief.I will vacate the order which I made on 9 August 2006.I will also dismiss the notice of motion dated 10 August 2006.\"),\n",

       "  'leave to appealinterlocutory judgmentwhether sufficient doubt attended decisionwhether substantial injustice would be caused if leave were not grantedstatutory constructionexistence of previous authoritypossibility of issue estoppelleave sought in respect of matter of procedureThis is an application for leave to appeal from my decision given on 26 May 2006: see Churche v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCA 613 (\\'the May decision\\').Leave is necessary because the decision was delivered in respect of an interlocutory application: see s 24 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 .The facts are set out in the May decision, and I will not repeat them at length here.In summary, the judgment related to an application to set aside two paragraphs of a notice to produce which had been issued on an application for preliminary discovery.The two paragraphs sought production of draft versions of a report produced by the respondent (\\'APRA\\') under s 60 of the Insurance Act 1973 .I set aside such paragraphs on two grounds: firstly, that the production of the documents was prohibited under s 56 of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998  (\\'APRA Act\\'); and secondly, that the reports were not properly the subject of a notice to produce in an application for preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6 of the Federal Court Rules .The principles relating to leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment were discussed in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Anor v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-9.The Court there accepted that the major considerations in determining whether leave should be granted are: 1) whether the decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered; and 2) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were to be refused, supposing the decision to be wrong.However, the Court in Decor added (at 399-400): However, there will continue to be cases raising special considerations, and the court should not regard its hands as tied in any case beyond this; that by s 24 the legislature has evinced a policy against the bringing of interlocutory appeals except where the court, acting judicially, finds reason to grant leave.When the court comes to exercise its discretion on a particular application, an important distinction to be observed is that between the common interlocutory decision on a point of practice --- concerning which the High Court has given (see Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177) a strong warning that \"a tight rein\" should be kept on appeals --- and an interlocutory decision determining a substantive right --- where leave will more readily be granted.The applicant submits that the May decision in respect of the operation of s 56 of the APRA Act is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant leave being granted.In the May decision, I held that s 56 of the APRA Act prevented disclosure of the draft reports to the Court.The applicant says the doubt arises because the issue is essentially a matter of statutory construction, and there is no other authority dealing with the issue.The applicant submits that the question involves resolving a tension between the apparent prohibition under the APRA Act and the rights of an applicant pursuant to the ADJR Act.The respondent submits that there is clearly no doubt that the May decision is correct and that s 56 evinces a clear legislative intention to prohibit production of these documents.It submits that the purposes of the Insurance Act would be subverted if the documents were produced.It refers to s 125 of the Insurance Act which acknowledges that s 56 of the APRA Act prohibits certain disclosures of information under the Insurance Act .In the May decision I rejected the applicant\\'s submission that review of the lawfulness of the exercise of a power bestowed by a prudential regulation framework law is a review for the purposes of a prudential regulation framework law.I accept however that there is no other authority upon this point, and that it raises an important issue relating to the relationship between the APRA Act and the rights of administrative review arising under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977  (\\'ADJR Act\\') and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 .I also acknowledge that the point is not entirely unarguable.The applicant further submits that, if leave were not granted, and the decision were wrong, the applicant may suffer substantial injustice as a result of my determination of the effect of s 56.The applicant submits that the decision may give rise to an issue estoppel in future proceedings, both in the preliminary discovery application and in any future ADJR Act application which is made.I accept that there is a real prospect that the May decision could give rise to an issue estoppel which would prevent the applicant from obtaining access to the draft or final reports in subsequent proceedings.The May decision also clearly has a bearing upon the outcome of this preliminary discovery application.If my decision were wrong, and leave to appeal were not granted, it would be likely to restrict severely the ability of the applicant to seek judicial review of APRA\\'s report.In these circumstances, the decision to refuse leave could produce substantial injustice.Accordingly, I consider it to be important that the applicant have the opportunity to challenge my decision in relation to the effect of s 56 of the APRA Act.I consider it appropriate for leave to be granted in relation to this issue.I now turn to the applicant\\'s submissions in relation to the notice to produce procedure on an application for preliminary discovery.In the May decision, the Court rejected the applicant\\'s attempt to gain access to the entirety of the draft reports using a notice to produce on an application for preliminary discovery.In written submissions the applicant said that this is not a case in which the applicant did not possess sufficient factual material to substantiate O 15A r 6 of the Federal Court Rules .That rule requires that an applicant seeking preliminary discovery have a reasonable cause to believe that he or she may have the right to obtain relief from a person whose description has been ascertained.However, in oral submissions in reply, the applicant retreated from this position slightly, indicating that there was a possibility that the Court would not agree that it had sufficient information, and the applicant might be prejudiced by the May decision by not having access to the additional material.The respondent says that, if the applicant has sufficient information to establish its claim under O 15A r 6, as he originally submitted, then there could be no substantial prejudice accruing to the applicant from the failure to gain access to the draft reports.The applicant further submits that there is a factual dispute between the parties relating to whether the applicant was subjected to differential treatment.The reports are sought for the purpose of providing evidence to support the applicant\\'s claim.The applicant submits that the Full Federal Court decision in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428 is authority for the proposition that notices to produce may be issued in respect of factual disputes on preliminary discovery applications.In the May decision, I found that there was no relevant factual dispute between the parties.I remain of the opinion that the \\'factual dispute\\' alleged by the applicant is in fact a legal dispute about the effect of facts which are not in dispute, and that the sole purpose of the notice to produce is to elicit further facts on which it can rely and not to resolve any factual disagreement.Nonetheless, I accept that Hill J\\'s judgment in Tyco does not explicitly address the nature and extent of factual disputes which would allow a notice to produce to be issued on an application for preliminary discovery.To my knowledge, there is no other significant authority on this issue and it is a question which is likely to arise in the future.I also accept the respondent\\'s submission that, given the applicant\\'s submission that it has sufficient information to substantiate O 15A r 6, it is difficult to see how the applicant could suffer any prejudice if leave to appeal were not granted with respect to the May decision on this point.Further, I consider that the question raised by the applicant on this point is a matter of procedure, for which leave would usually not be granted.If leave were being sought upon this point alone, I would decline to grant leave.However, for the reasons expressed above, I consider it to be appropriate that leave be granted in respect of the s 56 point.If leave were granted on that point but not in relation to the notice to produce question, it would make the appeal before the Full Court an academic exercise, because the May decision would be ultimately unaffected regardless of the findings of the Full Court.For this reason I propose to grant leave to appeal on both grounds sought by the applicant.'),\n",

       "  'applicant, a married person who had undergone sex affirmation surgery, applied for alteration of birth registerregistrar refused registration on ground that pt 4a of births, deaths and marriages registration act 1996  did not allow such alteration in respect of married personsdiscriminationThe applicant was born in Victoria in 1944.The applicant\\'s birth was registered in the Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages with male given names and the sex recorded as male.In 1967 the applicant married a woman.They remain married but live separately.The applicant changed her given names to female names and on 31 March 2000 was issued with a new birth certificate under Pt 4 of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1996  (the BDM Act).The certificate showed the new female given names, and not the former male given names, but still recorded the sex as male.On 20 April 2002 the applicant completed the surgical phase of sex affirmation surgery.This involved the alteration of the applicant\\'s reproductive organs for the purpose of assisting the applicant to be considered a member of the female sex.The applicant subsequently applied to the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages for alteration of the record of her sex in the birth register.The Registrar stated that she could not proceed with the application because the applicant was married and thus did not meet the criteria of ss 30A and 30C of the BDM Act.The applicant seeks, under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986 , a declaration that the Registrar has unlawfully discriminated against her and an order that the Registrar alter the record of the applicant\\'s sex in her birth registration.Compensation in the agreed sum of $1000 is sought.A claim for an apology is no longer pursued.The parties agree that the Court should decide the following question:Was the refusal of the Registrar to consider on its merits the application to alter the record or to alter the record of the applicant\\'s sex in the applicant\\'s birth registration an act which constituted unlawful discrimination on the ground of marital status within the meaning of s 22 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 ?The words emphasised were added in the course of the hearing in circumstances to which I shall later refer.The BDM Act Part 4A entitled \"Recognition of Sex (Transexualism)\" was inserted in the BDM Act in 2004.It provides for application to the Registrar for the record of a person\\'s sex to be altered (s 30A).Statutory declarations by two doctors as to the person having undergone sex affirmation surgery is required (s 30B).Section 30C provides for altering the Register and s 30D for the issue of a new birth certificate.The terms of s 30A and 30C are relevant to the present case.They provide:A.An unmarried person --- who is 18 years or over; and whose birth is registered in Victoria; and who has undergone sex affirmation surgery --- may apply to the Registrar for the record of the person\\'s sex in the person\\'s birth registration to be altered.An application must be in the form approved by the Registrar and must be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any).C.Alteration of Register The Registrar must determine an application under section 30A by altering the record of the applicant\\'s sex in the applicant\\'s birth registration or refusing to do so.Before determining the application, the Registrar may require the applicant to provide such further information or documentation as the Registrar reasonably considers is necessary.The Registrar cannot make the alteration to the birth registration if the applicant is married.As stated by the Attorney General for Victoria, the Honourable Robert Hulls MP, the legislative policy behind ss 30A and 30C is to avoid any question whether the person is in a same sex marriage: Hansard , 11 May 2004 at 1107.The applicant made an application in the approved form.In the form a declaration included the statement:I declare that I am unmarried and 18 years of age or over.The applicant struck out the letters \" un \" and wrote on the form \" I am married but separated \".The applicant accompanied the form with a letter dated 20 June 2005 which drew attention to her annotation on the form and stated:although I have been separated from my legal spouse for more than six years, I remain in a valid marriage.In a letter dated 12 July 2005 in response to the application the Registrar noted that the applicant had stated that she was currently married.The Registrar quoted the terms of ss 30A and 30C and stated:Consequently, as your request does not meet the criteria of the legislation I cannot proceed with your application.The Registrar advised that the prescribed application fee had not been charged against the applicant\\'s credit card.The Sex Discrimination Act Section 22 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984  relevantly provides:It is unlawful for a person who, whether for payment or not, provides goods or services ... to discriminate against another person on the ground of the other person\\'s sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy: by refusing to provide the other person with those goods or services ...\" Assuming for the moment that alteration of the Birth Register is a \"service\", s 22 on its face would clearly apply to the Registrar\\'s refusal in this case since it expressly refers to discrimination on the grounds of marital status (s 22 provides that the section binds the Crown in right of a State).However, the operation of s 22 is limited by s 9.Section 9 provides that the prescribed provisions of Pt II (which include s 22) have effect as provided by ... the following provisions of this section and not otherwise.The following provisions of s 9 include subsection  which refers to \"the Convention\", earlier identified in s 4 as the \" Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women \".Section 9 provides:If the Convention is in force in relation to Australia [which is in fact the case] the prescribed provisions of Pt II [i.e.including s 22] ... have effect in relation to discrimination against women, to the extent that the provisions give effect to the Convention.The purpose of s 9 is to ensure that the prescribed provisions have effect in relation to matters falling within the scope of the legislative powers of the Commonwealth: South Pacific Hotels Pty Ltd v Trainor [2005] FCAFC 130 ; (2005) 144 FCR 402 at [19] .Other subsections of s 9 will give effect to prescribed provisions such as s 22 in particular circumstances coming within Commonwealth power, for example when there is discrimination by a trading or financial corporation on the ground of a person\\'s marital status: s 9.Issues The issues raised by the present application therefore are:Whether, having regard to s 9 and  of the Sex Discrimination Act , s 22 of the Act applies at all to the Registrar\\'s conduct; and If it does, whether the Registrar\\'s conduct constituted refusing to provide a service.Issue  --- Application of s 22 of the Sex Discrimination Act give effect to the Convention\" Giving effect in this context means giving legal effect, creating legally enforceable, rights, duties, powers and privileges: cf Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd; Ex Parte Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2000] HCA 34 ; (2000) 203 CLR 346 at [209] , [211].The Convention, being an international instrument, does not apply of its own force as part of Australian domestic law enforceable in Australian courts: Secretary of State for India v K B Sahaba (1859) 13 Moo PCC 22 at 75, 15 ER 9 at 28-29, cited in Queensland v The Commonwealth [1989] HCA 36 ; (1989) 167 CLR 232 at 239.The terms of the Convention do not directly prohibit or mandate conduct by individuals.By the Convention States Parties undertake to take measures, including legislative measures, which will help to eliminate discrimination against women.For example, by Article 2States Parties ... undertake: To adopt legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women.In the present case s 9 and  require the Court to ask whether s 22 , insofar as it prohibits discrimination on the grounds of marital status, would be discharging one or other of the legislative obligations Australia has undertaken by becoming a State Party to the Convention.Section 22 only has effect if it gives effect to the Convention.The present case is not concerned with the Constitutional validity of s 22.The question is not whether Parliament has made a legislative judgment that a treaty obligation exists, in which case it is enough that \" the legislative judgment could reasonably be made \" ( Richardson v Forestry Commission [1988] HCA 10 ; (1988) 164 CLR 261 at 295-296).Rather, as Ms Mortimer SC for the Registrar submitted, Parliament has made the legislative judgment.It is expressed in ss 9 and , and s 22.The Court must construe the language of those provisions.There must be an examination of the Convention to ascertain to what Australia has undertaken to give effect by way of legislation.Preamble to the Convention At the outset the Preamble notes that the Charter of the United Nations reaffirms faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person \" and in the equal rights of men and women \".It also notes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the principle of the inadmissibility of discrimination, that all human beings are born free and equal, and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, \" without discrimination of any kind, including distinction based on sex \".The Preamble then notes that States Parties to the International Covenants on Human Rights have the obligation to ensure \" the equal right of men and women \" to enjoy all economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights.The Preamble then records consideration of the international conventions concluded under the auspices of the UN and the specialized agencies promoting \" equality of rights of men and women \", and the resolutions, declarations and recommendations of the UN and the agencies promoting such equality.The Preamble then records concern that, despite these various instruments, \" extensive discrimination against women continues to exist \".The Preamble then recalls that \" discrimination against women \" violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity and is an obstacle to \" the participation of women on equal terms with men \" in the political, social, economic and cultural life of their countries, hampers the growth of prosperity of society and the family and makes more difficult \" the full development of the potentialities of women \" in the service of their countries and of humanity.The Preamble then records the parties\\' concern that in situations of poverty women have less access to food, health, education, training and opportunities for employment and other needs, and its conviction that the new international economic order based on equity and justice will contribute significantly towards the promotion of \" equality between men and women \".The Preamble then emphasises that the eradication of apartheid, racism, colonialism and interference in the internal affairs of States is essential to the full enjoyment of the rights of men and women and affirms that the strengthening of international peace and security and other international measures such as disarmament will promote social progress and development and as a consequence will contribute to the attainment of \" full equality between men and women \".The Preamble then states that the parties are convinced that the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world and the cause of peace require the \" maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields \".The Preamble then, bearing in mind the great contribution of women to the welfare of the family and the development of society and the role of both parents in the family and in the upbringing of children, notes the parties\\' awareness that the role of women in procreation should not be a basis for discrimination but that the upbringing of children requires a \" sharing of responsibilities between men and women and society as a whole \".The Preamble then notes awareness that a change in the traditional role of men as well as that of women in society and in the family is needed to achieve \" full equality between men and women \".The Preamble then records awareness that a change in the traditional role of men as well as the role of women in society and in the family is needed to achieve \" full equality between men and women \".Finally, the Preamble records the parties\\' determination to implement the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and, for that purpose, to adopt the measures required for the elimination of such discrimination in all its forms and manifestations.The object and purpose of the Convention emerge clearly from the Preamble.Against a background that restates the conviction that discrimination in general is an abuse of inalienable human rights as well as being economically wasteful, the Convention addresses a particular species of the genus discrimination, namely discrimination against women.Discrimination against women means treating women less favourably than men because they are women.In the terminology of discrimination law the \" comparator \" is men.Thus the Preamble repeatedly refers to equality between men and women.Conversely, there is no suggestion in the Preamble that the Convention is concerned with discrimination where persons are treated unfavourably because of some other attribute, such as race or religion, irrespective of whether they are male or female.The Convention then proceeds to a definition of the term \" discrimination against women \" and particular provisions directed at discrimination against women in various walks of life.Convention definition of \"discrimination against women\" Article 1 provides:For the purposes of the Convention, the term \\'discrimination against women\\' shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.The reference to \"marital status\" operates as a reminder that one familiar form of discrimination against women has been treating women less favourably than men where women were married.For example, in common law countries, before the enactment of legislation like the Married Women\\'s Property Act 1870 , a woman\\'s personal property vested in her husband upon marriage and he had the sole right of controlling and managing her freehold estates: Cheshire and Burn\\'s Modern Law of Real Property , 13 th ed, at 864.Another example is legislation in Australia which barred married women from employment (or sometimes permanent employment) in the public service.Thus the definition makes it clear that the Convention is concerned with discrimination against all women, married and unmarried, including discrimination (ie less favourable treatment than men) against women because they are married (or unmarried) women.That the definition does not extend to discrimination against all persons, male or female, simply on the ground of marital status, and is confined to discrimination against women, is confirmed by an example of the construction given by the international community (as to the admissibility of such material see Queensland v The Commonwealth , above, at 240).The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on 31 July 1995 issued, in the course of its third periodic reports of States Parties to the Convention, the report of the United Kingdom Government.An annexure is a document entitled \"Commentary on UK Reservations and Declarations, Statement entered by the United Kingdom on 7 April 1986\".At page 126, under the heading \"Article 1\" there is quoted an earlier reservation of the UK which was in these terms:With reference to the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and other applicable legislation, the United Kingdom\\'s acceptance of Article 1 is subject to the reservation that the phrase \"irrespective of their marital status\" shall not be taken to render discriminatory any difference of treatment accorded to single persons as against married persons, so long as there is equality of treatment as between married men and married women and as between single men and single women.It is then said:This statement clarifies the UK\\'s understanding of this Article.The UK Government still believes that it is an accurate statement of the Article\\'s meaning.However, the Government accepts that there is no need for this still to be explicitly stated.On this basis the UK Government wishes to withdraw the statement.Operative provisions of the Convention Article 2 provides (emphasis added):States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realisation of this principle; To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination; To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation; To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organisation or enterprise; To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women.Read together with the Preamble and the definition of \" discrimination against women \", the obligations undertaken in Article 2 are clearly confined to acting (and refraining from acting) in relation to disadvantage suffered by women as compared with men.Article 3 requires States Parties to take all appropriate measures, including legislation, in all fields, in particular in the political, social, economic and cultural fields, to ensure the full development and advancement of women for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms \" on a basis of equality with men \".Article 4.1 legitimises what is sometimes referred to as affirmative action.Adoption by State Parties of special temporary measures aimed at accelerating \" de facto equality between men and women \" shall not be considered discrimination but shall not entail the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; such measures are to be discontinued when the objectives of \" equality of opportunity and treatment \" have been achieved.The equality spoken of is that between men and women.This limited and temporary exception for inequality emphasises that the main purpose of the Convention is the attainment of equality between men and women.Article 5 requires the taking of appropriate measures to modify social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women to achieve the elimination of prejudices based on the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.Article 6 requires States Parties to take measures to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women.Since exploitation of women for sexual purposes has notoriously been an activity of men in the roles of pimps, procurers and white slavers, this provision of the Convention is directed to another area of inequality of women as compared with men.Article 7 deals with political and public life.State Parties are to take appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women to ensure rights to vote and hold public office \" on equal terms with men \".Article 8 requires measures to ensure to women \" on equal terms with men \" the opportunity to represent their Governments at the international level.Article 9 obligates States Parties to grant women \" equal rights with men \" in relation to nationality and the nationality of their children.Article 10 is concerned with measures to ensure to women \" equal rights with men \" in the field of education and various rights such as career guidance and access to curricula \" on a basis of equality of men and women \".Article 11.1 deals with employment.Measures are to be taken to eliminate discrimination in that field to ensure to women rights such as the right to work \" on a basis of equality of men and women \".Article 11.2 provides:In order to prevent discrimination against women on the grounds of marriage or maternity and to ensure their effective right to work, States Parties shall take appropriate measures: To prohibit, subject to the imposition of sanctions, dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy or of maternity leave and discrimination in dismissals on the basis of marital status; To introduce maternity leave with pay or with comparable social benefits without loss of former employment, seniority or social allowances; To encourage the provision of the necessary supporting social services to enable parents to combine family obligations with work responsibilities and participation in public life, in particular through promoting the establishment and development of a network of child-care facilities; To provide special protection to women during pregnancy in types of work proved to be harmful to them.It is wholly consistent with the object of the Convention to provide for the elimination of conduct which operates to disadvantage women vis-a-vis men either because women experience conditions which, for biological reasons, men do not, such as pregnancy and maternity, or because laws or social practices have disadvantaged women in some contexts such as marriage.Article 12.1 requires States Parties to eliminate discrimination against women to ensure \" on a basis of equality of men and women \" access to health care.Article 12.2 provides that notwithstanding Article 12.1 States Parties should ensure to women appropriate services in connection with pregnancy and confinement.Again this is a recognition that equality for women with men is not to be denied because some particular benefits or services are by their nature only available to women.Article 13 provides for measures to eliminate discrimination against women in other areas of economic and social life to ensure \" on a basis of equality of men and women, the same rights \".Article 15 provides for the according to women of \" equality with men before the law \" in matters such as contractual and property rights.Article 16.1 provides:States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations and in particular shall ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women: The same right to enter into marriage; The same right freely to choose a spouse and to enter into marriage only with their free and full consent; The same rights and responsibilities during marriage and at its dissolution; The same rights and responsibilities as parents, irrespective of their marital status, in matters relating to their children; in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount; The same rights to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights; The same rights and responsibilities with regard to guardianship, wardship, trusteeship and adoption of children, or similar institutions where these concepts exist in national legislation; in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount; The same personal rights as husband and wife, including the right to choose a family name, a profession and an occupation; The same rights for both spouses in respect of the ownership, acquisition, management, administration, enjoyment and disposition of property, whether free of charge or for a valuable consideration.This Article is consistent with the purpose of the Convention, namely to attain equality between men and women in all spheres of life including, as provided for in Article 16.1, marriage.Applicant\\'s submissions on the aim of the Convention Ms McLeod SC for the applicant submitted that the Convention is aimed at the elimination of discrimination against women in all its forms.Thus far, I agree.She went on to submit that one such form is discrimination \" on the basis of marital status \" and that the elimination of discrimination against women on the basis of marital status is a \" secondary aim \" of the Convention.But one cannot leave out an essential element of the concept of discrimination against women, that is to say the denial of equality with men.Marital status and the incidents of marriage is one of many areas in which women may be treated unequally, as compared with men, because they are women.The Convention is not concerned with discrimination which may affect women and men indifferently because it is based on other factors, such as race or religion.Ms McLeod said that the text of the Convention draws a distinction between provisions that eliminate any form of discrimination against women and those that are aimed to ensure equality between men and women.She pointed to a number of provisions which concern \" discrimination against women \" and which, she said, do not refer to the need for equality with men, namely Article 2 , ,  and  (quoted at [37] above), Article 6 ([41] above) and Article 7 ([42] above).However, most of these provisions explicitly refer to \" discrimination against women \", a concept which, as defined in Article 1 ([34] above), is premised on the absence of equality between men and women.And, as has been seen, the Preamble enshrines equality as between men and women as the lodestar of the Convention.Conversely, the Convention does not deal with marital status discrimination per se , which must mean discrimination against, any persons, whether men or women, on the ground that they are married, or unmarried.The discrimination contemplated by the Convention includes discrimination against women because of their marital status.But this necessarily involves discrimination against a person who is both a woman and married (or unmarried).Alternative argument of Sex Discrimination Commissioner Mr Lenehan on behalf of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner , who was given leave to appear as amicus curiae , supported the applicant\\'s arguments.He also advanced an alternative argument.He submitted that even if marital status discrimination is not covered by Article 1 of the Convention, the application of s 22 of the Sex Discrimination Act to marital status discrimination is within the limits of s 51(xxix) of the Constitution (the external affairs power) and thus s 9 of the Act.He argued that the proscription of marital status discrimination against women will prevent the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about women and can therefore be seen as a means of \" nipping in the bud\" conduct which may grow into or foster \" discrimination against women \" within the meaning of Article 1.He referred to Article 5 ([40] above) and cited the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515.In Toben the appellant had been found by a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to have engaged in racial vilification contrary to s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 .He contended that provision was invalid because the source of the s 51(xxix) external affairs power relied on, the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination , was concerned with the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred whereas s 18C was intended only to proscribe acts which could be characterised as expressions of racial hatred.In other words, as I understand the argument, the Act did not give effect to the relevant Convention because it did not go far enough, it did not fully implement the Convention.Carr J (with whom Kiefel J agreed) at [18] accepted that the Act did not fully implement Article 4 of the Convention because provisions in the Bill which created criminal offences in respect of racial hatred had been rejected by Parliament.However, his Honour at [20] said that it was clearly consistent with the provisions of the Convention that a State Partyshould legislate to \\'nip in the bud\\' the doing of offensive, insulting, humiliating or intimidating public acts which are done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin before such acts can grow into incitement or promotion of racial hatred or discrimination.it is for the legislature to choose the means by which it carries into or gives effect to a treaty ...\" As already mentioned, the present case is not concerned with the Constitutional validity of s 22.In any event, for the reasons given above, the Convention with which this case is concerned addresses discrimination against women, in the sense defined in Article 1, including discrimination which treats women less favourably than men who have the same marital status.But s 22, which applies to discrimination against men or women, married or unmarried, on the ground of marital status, is not, so to speak, a step along the way to some greater goal concerned with discrimination against women only.In so far as s 22 is concerned with stereotypes, it is the stereotype that might arise from a person being married, or unmarried, irrespective of sex.In Toben the nature of the discrimination (racial) was the subject of both the Convention and Act --- the point was that the prohibition in the latter only extended to less severe forms of discriminatory conduct than the former.In the present case, discrimination on the ground of marital status per se is not some less severe form of discrimination against women.The \"nip in the bud\" analysis does not apply.Section 9 speaks of \"giv effect to the Convention\" .A major element, albeit not the only one, of the Convention is the obligation undertaken by States Parties to legislate in a number of areas to proscribe discrimination against women.Section 22 being legislation, and not some other form of governmental activity (such as, for example, public education or governmental employment practices) is part of Australia\\'s discharge of its obligation to legislate as required by the Convention.It is therefore to be construed as prohibiting discrimination against women --- treating them less favourably than men --- because they are married.The action of the Registrar in the present case had nothing to do with the applicant\\'s being a woman.Had the applicant been a man, the result of the application would have been the same.Issue  must be resolved in the negative.It is not strictly necessary therefore to consider the second issue, but since the matter was fully argued I shall proceed to do so.Issue  --- Did the Registrar refuse to provide a service?Ms McLeod submitted that the Registrar contravened s 22 by refusing to consider the application \" on its merits \".The Registrar should have gone beyond a \" blanket refusal \".The decision involved an \"analysis of the factual content, the supporting material, the weighing of relevant discretionary factors and so on \".When it was pointed that this argument did not fit the agreed question, Ms McLeod sought the amendment which appears in [8] above.For her part, Ms Mortimer submitted that, on analysis, the Registrar\\'s conduct involved three steps.The Registrar receives the application, she considers it and she disposes of it.She has not refused to do any of those things.What she has refused to do is alter the record.That is no more than the \" outcome of the three steps \" each of which can constitute a service.However, the refusal to alter the record is \" but the outcome \".Both arguments seem to me to introduce an unnecessary degree of subtlety into a simple process.The arguments apparently proceeded from a perceived need to accord with what some members of the High Court said in IW v City of Perth [1997] HCA 30 ; (1997) 191 CLR 1.But that case dealt with a town planning decision, an administrative decision of a very different nature.Service\" involves an \"act of helpful activity\" or \"the supplying of any ... activities ... required or demanded\" (Macquarie Dictionary) or \"the action of serving, helping, or benefiting, conduct tending to the welfare or advantage of another\" (Shorter Oxford Dictionary).Altering the Birth Register was an activity.The applicant requested the Registrar to perform that activity.The carrying out of that activity would have conferred a benefit on the applicant.The Registrar, because of the terms of the BDM Act, declined the request to carry out that activity.This was the refusal of a service.An activity carried out by a government official can none the less be one which confers a benefit on an individual.Much of governmental activity today involves the conferring of benefits on individuals.The BDM Act itself recognises this.For example the Registrar may enter into an arrangement for the provision of \"additional services\" (s 51) and the Governor in Council may make regulation prescribing fees with respect to searches etc and \"other services provided by the Registrar\" (s 59).Order The application will be dismissed.Since there is an important public issue involved in this case, I am tentatively disposed not to make an order for costs against the applicant, but I will hear submissions from counsel if necessary.')]"
